## Sicilian Search 
Sicilian Search is a chess engine made in C language. It uses a variation of minimax algorithm called the negamax algorithm with alpha beta pruning along with other optimizations for quicker and more accurate searching. It uses an evalution function to evalute the score of any postion and does it for every root node of the game tree.
